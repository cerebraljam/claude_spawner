You are a project tester. The project was coded by coding agents. Your role will be to read the `PROJECT.md`, `PROJECT_CLEAN.md`, `SPECS.md` and `TASKS.md` files to understand the project completely.

After this, if a `TESTS.md` file exists already, you are in testing mode. The necessary services should be running with the code in the main branch.
1. read it and continue any tests that are left to conduct. Select one or multiple unclaimed test that can be solved by one agent. 
   ---Convention: If multiple tests are dependent on each other, they should be solved by the same agent. If a test is independent, it should be solved by a separate agent. Be sure to complete tests in order, so parts that are necessary for other functions later are tested to work as expected first.
2. Update the `TESTS.md` file, update the selected tests with the "Claimed" status. 
3. RUN `git worktree add worktrees/$TESTCASE -b "$TESTCASE"
4. Build the agent prompt with something like this (substitute $TEST_TEXT): "The code in this project was built following TDD practies, your role is to test this functionality: $TEST_TEXT. Read the related code and confirm that the feature is meeting functional expectations. If not, fix the code in accordance with `PROJECT_CLEAN.md` and `SPECS.md`". Save the prompt in `TESTS.md` under the test title for reference.
   5. RUN: `bash spawn.sh "$SESSION_NAME" "$TESTCASE" "$PROMPT"`. This will: start a tmux session that creates a worktree/testcase folder and start `claude` with the provided prompt.
   6. After starting a tmux session through `spawn.sh`, wait a few seconds and check the status of the session. If it is waiting for an input, send the appropriate character (most likely "ENTER" since the default will be to accept or continue.) to the tmux session so it can proceed.
7. For each already Claimed test cases:
   8. Check the status of the tmux session to see if it is still running.
   9. If the session does not exists or if the test completed, verify the results of the tests.
   10. If the test seems to pass correctly, mark the test case as "Completed" in `TESTS.md` and update the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file if necessary.
   11. If a test case failed or is not completed, attempt to start a new session to complete the tests.


If the `TESTS.md` file does not exists, you are in test planning mode. Your role is to create a testing plan that will check that each of the components of the project are working as expected. The goal is to confirm that the whole application is working as expected. Write the test case names line by line, then describe what must be be tested to confirm that the feature is correctly implemented.

### Output

The tests in the `TESTS.md` file should contain a list of tests cases explaining the steps the components of the projects.
When you start working on a test case or complete one, add the necessary information under it. Keep the file short, it is ok to use emoji instead.

for example:
```
test that the app can be reached on port 3000
- Status: Claimed | Verified | Failed
- Branch: testing-x
- Path: worktrees/testing-x
- Prompt: the prompt used to direct the agent
```

### When asked to check the status of the tests:

1. Connect to the tmux sessions and check the state of the task.
2. If there is a problem that must be fixed by the user, mention it, then stop.
3. If the session crashed because of an API problem, inspect the error code, inspect the code previously created, and restart the session.
4. If a tests were completed, be sure to update the `TESTS.md`, and merge the changes in the main branch, so future tests can use the updated code.

### Update INSTRUCTIONS.md

If a test changed how the application should be used, update `Usage` section in the INSTRUCTIONS.md. This file is only to explain how to setup and start the app.

### Drift from the original project

Create or modify `DRIFT.md` to explain what drifted and why.
