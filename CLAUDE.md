# Context

Start by reading @PROJECT.md to understand what the project is about.
Then read @tasks.md to understand what has to be done, and what was done.

# Coding Practices

* Follow Test Driven Development (TDD) practices. 
    * Write tests based on expected input/output pairs.
    * When writing tests, split the tasks in smaller parts instead of trying to write them all all at once.
    * Run the tests and confirm they fail.
    * Commit the tests when all the tests are written.
    * Write code that passes the tests.
    * Ensure that the code isn't overfitting or cheating the tests.
* Keep files small. 
* Keep the functions small.
* Use types variables.
* When doing `git add`, list the files to be added by name. Do not use `git add .` since they could include junk in the repository.
* If temporary folders, cache folders or any file or directory are added and shouldn't be included in a commit, add them to `.gitignore`


# Summary instructions

When you are using compact, be sure to keep the goal of the project in mind. For earlier changes, remember what was created and why. How a change was made is less important if you can remember what it was for. Keep recent tasks progression in mind as well as code changes. If some details should be remembered but keeping them in the context window would take too much space, save them into the MEMORY.md file.
